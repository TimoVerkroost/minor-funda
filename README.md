# Prototype a new search functionality for Funda
Use the APIs of Funda to get your own ideas and understanding a new way of seeking homes. A list, on a map, or another way, everything is worth considering! The aim is to help the Funda user to find their perfect home quickly and easily.

## User story
As Funda user I want to get suggestions of homes that I think might be interesting, so I get that offer just outside my search.

### Possible solutions
- When a user searches with a max price suggest more houses with 5% higher price.
- When a user searches with a min price suggest more houses with 5% lesser price.
- When a user searches within a specific area or place suggest a +5km range and +10km range with the same filters.
- When a user searches and is logged in use the saved homes to suggest other houses in the neighbourhood.
